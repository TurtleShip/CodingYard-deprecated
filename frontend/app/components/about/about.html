    Hi, I am Seulgi and I occasionally solve programming problems for fun.
    I go by TurtleShip in most coding competitions, and you can
    also find me on <a href="github.com/TurtleShip" target="_blank">Github</a>.

    <br/>
    I thought it would be great if there was a place where my friends and I
    can upload our solutions and share them, so I built this website.
    Anyone on the web on Internet can view all solutions host on this website.
