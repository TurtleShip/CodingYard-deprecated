### Why users become Guest when they sign up, and why can't Guests upload solutions?

I wanted to prevent malicious users from signing up and uploading random contents. The main goal of CodingYard is to serve good contents, not getting as many users as possible. So I am okay with Guest users having to wait a little until they get promoted to Member.

### How can a Guest become a member?
Contact Admin or Gloal Admin and ask them to promote you.
