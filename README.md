# Overview
This is a website for sharing solutions to coding competitions. It is hosted at [www.codingyard.com](http://www.codingyard.com), or you can host it yourself. Check out [installation guide](docs/INSTALL_GUIDE.md) if you want to host it yourself.

You can **sort the results** using specific criteria as well, such as *by Author* or *by Uploaded At*. You can also click a specific entry from the results to see the full content of the solution you selected.
